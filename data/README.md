# Data folder hierarchy

`public/` for files that are intetionally published alongisde the code for peer review
- manually compiled database of animal origin proportion per food item
- taxonomy of food recipe codes into classes

`main/` is for files used in the analysis code. These files do not contain personally identifiable information. These could feasibly be shared through version control, but so far are not. They are generated by running notebooks in `src/preprocess` on the raw data files to remove any personally identifiable information (PII)

`RAW/` is for input files received from outside systems, when they need to be pseudonymized or otherwise preprocessed before analysis.

# Rules of thumb

- Never manually edit files received as exports from systems. Such as Aromi or RedCAP. We should be able to to just get a new export at any time and overwrite the previous file.
